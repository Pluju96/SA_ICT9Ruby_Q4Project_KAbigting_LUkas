Despite all of this, I hope my mental health is a lot better<br>than it was during this school year.<br>I'll miss this school year and all of its wackiness, and I'll especially miss ICT class. I loved interacting with you, so it'll be really sad for me to let you go. I didn't expect myself to get this far in this particular subject, but you and your character really helped me through the toughest of times. Thank you for all you've done for me, Mr. Alimpolos.
